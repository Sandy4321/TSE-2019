I am trying to search for ROMAN_UPPER, to see where it’s used, as well as the SymbolTextDistance and NumberingType.\n', '(Barriers 5, row 85) I think I’ve taken a good work searching the source of the bug, but I do not think I’m going to do anything more productive today because it’s starting to frustrate me, and this research and verification needs patience and time to spend.', '(Barriers 6, row 3)  I click on it and it opens the development wiki. I feel excited, because I found information about how to contribute in a short time.', '(Barriers 6, row 5) Things I learned by reading the article: \n* I can contribute as a user or as developer. I fit into the second group.\n* There is a code review page and I can refer to it to find out things about the code repositories. \n', '(Barriers 6, row 24) I look down and realize that there are comments from people who contributed in some way to the bug. I noticed that in addition to code or reporting a bug, I can also contribute testing. It’s great to be able to contribute in many ways.', '(Barriers 6, row 27) Today, I learned about the Easy Hacks, and the way they are presented. Knowledge is always important, but I still want that code! My classmates already downloaded their codes, and I do not want to be left behind. I hope I get my code by Friday.', '(Barriers 6, row 28) Quick report about what is going to happen now. I confirmed with a classmate the problem regarding to my Ubuntu version: my version was no longer receiving support, so all the repositories were offline. I installed a new distribution and this one I’m sure still has support. ', '(Barriers 6, row 45) I accessed the LibreOffice website, I clicked on the “Developers”, available in the Community Menu. Then I clicked on “Get the code”.  Well, the information I wanted was all there. This menu explains how to download the code and how to compile it. Things are getting better: on the site, the compilation is being described the way it worked for me! Then I relaxed. Even if only for a moment.', ""(Barriers 6, row 47) I executed the command: “make debugrun”. And now what should I do, wait? I do not know what's about to happen. I do not know if it takes time to run, I do not know if I should have opened something. Nothing happened. I changed the command and executed “instdir/program/soffice”. And instantly the LibreOffice that I know as a user opens. I’m happy. During this project, I had only been happy when I discovered how to download the code."", '(Barriers 6, row 50) The website does not seem very informative for me. I’ll try to do some research on Google and Bugzilla (I learned how to use Bugzilla), and I’ll try to evolve. ', '(Barriers 7, row 1) During the lesson, I begin working in the second project of the the Capstone discipline. Initially, I navigate through the LibreOffice Portuguese page, trying to find the downloadable source code, in the community tab, I clicked on Developers option to do the download. However, I find out that for the compilation and the execution process, I need to be a Linux user.', '(Barriers 7, row 9) All the followed instructions were found on the official LibreOffice website, in the “Community / Developers” section, where there is a option to download the source code. In this section, there are some instructions about how to compile and run the software. I had some doubts, so I accessed the available Wiki link, and there is a video tutorial that really helped me a lot.', '(Barriers 7, row 14) I tried again using the command taken from the Wiki: ‘# git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core libreoffice’, this time the download started. After approximately 4 hours the download is completed, so now I’ll only follow the instructions suggested in the Wiki: using the ‘# cd libreoffice’ to access the LibreOffice folder, followed by  ‘# ./autogen.sh’, and then ‘# make’. A few more hours are needed (I started at 1:30 PM, and now it’s 03:20 PM, I have not finished yet, so I will sleep). When I woke up, around 7:30 AM, the process was still not finished, it only ended at 08:40 PM.', '(Barriers 7, row 15) \tApparently everything worked well with the compilation of LibreOffice. I looked for files in the downloaded folders that could help me with the LibreOffice contribution process, especially the READ ME file. I also accessed Bugzilla. Now, I’m looking for a bug to try to fix. \n', '(Barriers 8, row 3) Problem: I’m not a VIM user, so I don’t know the software. I downloaded the version 7.3.429 of VIM, and I’m trying to familiarize with it. As I don’t know the software, it’s hard to understand the bugs reported. \nSolution: I searched the basic VIM commands.\n', '(Barriers 8, row 4) Problem: Get the VIM source code. Solution: There are instructions in the website http://www.vim.org/develop.php, and it saysthat the best way to develop changes in VIM is through the Mercurial, so I downloaded the Mercurial (which I don’t know how to use), and then I downloaded through Mercurial a copy of the VIM source code.\n\n', '(Barriers 8, row 11) Problem: “What needs to be modified in dosinst.c to display the VIM icon on the menu?"" Solution: Looking at the code I realized that these information is made through the “Windows Registry”. Windows Registry is a hierarchical dataset that contains the configuration settings and system options in Windows. So the problem now is to understand how the Registry works. I looked at several websites trying to understand how to change Windows records and I discovered that there are Windows functions that create new registry keys. And that there is a regedit (software) that is used to change the records manually.', ""(Barriers 8, row 15) Since I was not successful in choosing from the list, I decided to look for a new list. I found information about this additional bug list on the VIM website (http://www.vim.org/develop.php). I decided to choose another bug from the list. The new bug is: An error message displayed is wrong. Instead of printing the error  'E163: There is only one file to edit', using the :next command with only one file open, the message printed is ‘empty buffer\n"", '(Barriers 8, row 19) Since I still can not find the value of the Windows registry to display the icon on the menu, I decided to look for another bug or improvement that could be done.\n\nLooking in this list (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list ), I chose another issue: <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>\n', ""(Barriers 8, row 24) 2) Another point is that when reading the original script, all the comments and the script itself were written with the purpose of not letting VIM be installed in a folder that does not end with 'vim' in a way, in my conclusion, very intentional.\n"", ""(Barriers 8, row 25) So, since one of the purposes of this work is to have an improvement or bug fix accepted by the project, I think this issue has a small chance of being accepted, because the folder name having to end with 'vim' is something purposeful\n"", '(Barriers 8, row 31) The E486 error message is set to ‘Pattern not found’. I searched on Google the term “E486 VIM”, and I got results that show that the error message corresponding to this errors is actually “Pattern not found”. So, in my conclusion, it is right that the error message is shown with the number E486.', '(Barriers 8, row 34) The bt_dontwrite(char* buf) function returns true if the buf is nowrite or nofile buffer. Buftype documentation from the website http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html:  \n< DOCUMENTATION HERE>. The message seems correct,  otherwise the message would be too long and would not look like a standard VIM error message. ', '(Barriers 8, row 36) Problem: Bugs in the “:help todo” list do not have a very large description, which makes it difficult to understand what needs to be done. Solution: I noticed that in the first list I found (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list), bugs were being registered at a reasonable frequency, a lot of bugs have been added to the list since I started working on the project, so I decided to go back to that list. And I realized there were new issues. I chose a issue that was added to the list on October 29th. <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>\n', '(Barriers 8, row 44) I searched the internet for this error and found these two sites:\nhttp://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/Vim-build-error-quot-no-terminal-library-found-quot-Was-Reformatting-numbered-lists-td3876565.html\nhttp://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Vim\nIt seems that I needed to download some dependencies before installing VIM.\nIn the site http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Vim, I found the following command to download these dependencies: apt-get build-dep vim-gnome.\nAfter I downloaded these dependencies the “make” worked.', '(Barriers 8, row 52) Problem: How to submit the changes?\nSolution: In the VIM official website, there is a section about development, which is where I found the information to download the source code of VIM, and where I found the lists of bugs and improvements (http://www.vim.org/develop.php). In this website, I also found information about what needs to be sent to the development group. They ask to generate, with the help of a mercurial functionality, a .diff file that contains the differences between the current source code and the one that I worked.', '(Barriers 8, row 55) I searched elsewhere and discovered a VIM FAQ here: http://vimhelp.appspot.com/vim_faq.txt.html. This site contains information about how to submit changes, and the site also says that in order to be able to send, you must first join the group. The information on how to join the group I found at: http://www.vim.org/maillist.php, I just needed to send an empty e-mail to vim-dev-subscribe@vim.org and wait for a confirmation.\n', '(Barriers 9, row 16) Following the guidelines of the link above, I observed two important items:\nIn http://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim-dev there are separate mailing lists for branches of the project. For example: Lists for ads, development, questions, support, etc. In https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list there is a list with 97 items that seems to be about bugs. These bugs have an identification number, a summary, a status and a priority. My goal now is to identify and understand a bug that can be fixed by me.']"
