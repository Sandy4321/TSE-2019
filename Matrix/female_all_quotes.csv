It’s very complicated to find something and “find myself” in these codes.', '(Barriers 6, row 2) From this link, there is a menu with 12 links or more. Among them, “Developers” and “Wiki”, which are the ones I clicked on. I open the “Developers” page. I see a link that looks interesting, which says “Learn about the code and development”.', '(Barriers 6, row 3)  I click on it and it opens the development wiki. I feel excited, because I found information about how to contribute in a short time.', '(Barriers 6, row 5) Things I learned by reading the article: \n* I can contribute as a user or as developer. I fit into the second group.\n* There is a code review page and I can refer to it to find out things about the code repositories. \n', '(Barriers 6, row 19) I typed in Google, “How to install git on Ubuntu”, and I found the following link: http://git-scm.com/book/pt-br/Primeiros-passos-Instalando-Git. I realized that it’s necessary to install some dependencies. I try to do what the tutorial asks me to do. Well, It didn’t worked again. For some reason that I don’t recognize, some links are offline. I can try to install it again later.', '(Barriers 6, row 24) I look down and realize that there are comments from people who contributed in some way to the bug. I noticed that in addition to code or reporting a bug, I can also contribute testing. It’s great to be able to contribute in many ways.', '(Barriers 6, row 27) Today, I learned about the Easy Hacks, and the way they are presented. Knowledge is always important, but I still want that code! My classmates already downloaded their codes, and I do not want to be left behind. I hope I get my code by Friday.', '(Barriers 6, row 28) Quick report about what is going to happen now. I confirmed with a classmate the problem regarding to my Ubuntu version: my version was no longer receiving support, so all the repositories were offline. I installed a new distribution and this one I’m sure still has support. ', '(Barriers 6, row 42) I can not stay here doing nothing. I’ll try to find out a solution on the website, because the Wiki is not very enlightening. I open the website, click on “Community”, “Developers”. Nothing that I’ve already done before. I click on “Get the code”. I read it quickly, but I don’t found anything different from what I already know. I return and now I click on the “Easy Hacks”. The Wiki page is opened (which in the 11th Log did not open)... Now, I read it.', '(Barriers 6, row 45) I accessed the LibreOffice website, I clicked on the “Developers”, available in the Community Menu. Then I clicked on “Get the code”.  Well, the information I wanted was all there. This menu explains how to download the code and how to compile it. Things are getting better: on the site, the compilation is being described the way it worked for me! Then I relaxed. Even if only for a moment.', ""(Barriers 6, row 47) I executed the command: “make debugrun”. And now what should I do, wait? I do not know what's about to happen. I do not know if it takes time to run, I do not know if I should have opened something. Nothing happened. I changed the command and executed “instdir/program/soffice”. And instantly the LibreOffice that I know as a user opens. I’m happy. During this project, I had only been happy when I discovered how to download the code."", '(Barriers 6, row 50) The website does not seem very informative for me. I’ll try to do some research on Google and Bugzilla (I learned how to use Bugzilla), and I’ll try to evolve. ', '(Barriers 7, row 1) During the lesson, I begin working in the second project of the the Capstone discipline. Initially, I navigate through the LibreOffice Portuguese page, trying to find the downloadable source code, in the community tab, I clicked on Developers option to do the download. However, I find out that for the compilation and the execution process, I need to be a Linux user.', '(Barriers 7, row 9) All the followed instructions were found on the official LibreOffice website, in the “Community / Developers” section, where there is a option to download the source code. In this section, there are some instructions about how to compile and run the software. I had some doubts, so I accessed the available Wiki link, and there is a video tutorial that really helped me a lot.', ""(Barriers 7, row 13) Since I don’t know what to do, so I’ll try to start the whole process again. All the instructions I followed were taken from the LibreOffice website, from Wiki and from the available video tutorial on the page. I  downloaded the source code again, using: ‘# git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core’ (It was taken from the LibreOffice webpage), and the following error occurred: ‘fatal: destination path 'core' already exists and is not an empty directory’."", '(Barriers 7, row 14) I tried again using the command taken from the Wiki: ‘# git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core libreoffice’, this time the download started. After approximately 4 hours the download is completed, so now I’ll only follow the instructions suggested in the Wiki: using the ‘# cd libreoffice’ to access the LibreOffice folder, followed by  ‘# ./autogen.sh’, and then ‘# make’. A few more hours are needed (I started at 1:30 PM, and now it’s 03:20 PM, I have not finished yet, so I will sleep). When I woke up, around 7:30 AM, the process was still not finished, it only ended at 08:40 PM.', '(Barriers 7, row 15) \tApparently everything worked well with the compilation of LibreOffice. I looked for files in the downloaded folders that could help me with the LibreOffice contribution process, especially the READ ME file. I also accessed Bugzilla. Now, I’m looking for a bug to try to fix. \n', '(Barriers 8, row 1) Problem: Where can I find the VIM source code, which version I should use and what are the bugs and improvements that can be made? What do I need to download to start implementing something? Where do I find this information? Solution: Not solved yet. I don’t know how to solve it. I searched for information on the following websites, but I’m lost:\nhttp://www.vim.org/sources.php\nhttp://code.google.com/p/vim/people/list\nhttp://code.google.com/p/vim/\nhttp://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/develop.html\nhttp://www.vim.org/\nI don’t know exactly what to do and where to start', '(Barriers 8, row 2) Attempting to solve the previous problem: I sent an e-mail to the class monitor, Igor, on 10/10, asking for information about where the bugs are reported and where I can find the VIM source code. But I still get no answer.  Solution for the previous problem: I found in http://www.vim.org/develop.php information about how the bugs are reported. Downloading VIM and typing the command “: help todo”, there is a bug list ordered by priority. It’s not a list very easy to understand, it’s a bit confusing, especially for someone who does not know VIM. Which leads to a new problem, I need to familiarize with the VIM.  Another website that can be used to find bugs is: https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list But it’s a little bit confusing too. ', '(Barriers 8, row 3) Problem: I’m not a VIM user, so I don’t know the software. I downloaded the version 7.3.429 of VIM, and I’m trying to familiarize with it. As I don’t know the software, it’s hard to understand the bugs reported. \nSolution: I searched the basic VIM commands.\n', '(Barriers 8, row 4) Problem: Get the VIM source code. Solution: There are instructions in the website http://www.vim.org/develop.php, and it saysthat the best way to develop changes in VIM is through the Mercurial, so I downloaded the Mercurial (which I don’t know how to use), and then I downloaded through Mercurial a copy of the VIM source code.\n\n', '(Barriers 8, row 5) Yesterday, after downloading the VIM source code,  I tried to understand it. It was very complicated, because there are a lot of .C files and not all the files have comments in the beginning explaining what the file is, or a general idea about the contents of the file, or at least, what the file functions are used for.\n', '(Barriers 8, row 8) I chose this issue because it’s not a bug, it’s an improvement in the system, and it’s referring to an operating system that I use, and also because it’s a issue easy to understand. Choosing this issue took a while because there were some issues that were difficult to understand. I think I spent about 2 hours, sweeping the list and trying to understand them.\n', '(Barriers 8, row 11) Problem: “What needs to be modified in dosinst.c to display the VIM icon on the menu?"" Solution: Looking at the code I realized that these information is made through the “Windows Registry”. Windows Registry is a hierarchical dataset that contains the configuration settings and system options in Windows. So the problem now is to understand how the Registry works. I looked at several websites trying to understand how to change Windows records and I discovered that there are Windows functions that create new registry keys. And that there is a regedit (software) that is used to change the records manually.', '(Barriers 8, row 12) However, I could not find the value that needs to be placed in the registries to show the icon. I looked at several websites, but i did not find anything that would help. The records do not have a default value, the values depend on the Windows version, and the software that placed these records.\n', ""(Barriers 8, row 15) Since I was not successful in choosing from the list, I decided to look for a new list. I found information about this additional bug list on the VIM website (http://www.vim.org/develop.php). I decided to choose another bug from the list. The new bug is: An error message displayed is wrong. Instead of printing the error  'E163: There is only one file to edit', using the :next command with only one file open, the message printed is ‘empty buffer\n"", '(Barriers 8, row 19) Since I still can not find the value of the Windows registry to display the icon on the menu, I decided to look for another bug or improvement that could be done.\n\nLooking in this list (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list ), I chose another issue: <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>\n', ""(Barriers 8, row 24) 2) Another point is that when reading the original script, all the comments and the script itself were written with the purpose of not letting VIM be installed in a folder that does not end with 'vim' in a way, in my conclusion, very intentional.\n"", ""(Barriers 8, row 25) So, since one of the purposes of this work is to have an improvement or bug fix accepted by the project, I think this issue has a small chance of being accepted, because the folder name having to end with 'vim' is something purposeful\n"", ""(Barriers 8, row 27) I decided to look in the other bug list, the list that is shown by typing the command: ‘:help todo’. This list is very complicated to understand. It's a bit difficult to know which bug has already been resolved and which ones are still open."", '(Barriers 8, row 31) The E486 error message is set to ‘Pattern not found’. I searched on Google the term “E486 VIM”, and I got results that show that the error message corresponding to this errors is actually “Pattern not found”. So, in my conclusion, it is right that the error message is shown with the number E486.', '(Barriers 8, row 34) The bt_dontwrite(char* buf) function returns true if the buf is nowrite or nofile buffer. Buftype documentation from the website http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html:  \n< DOCUMENTATION HERE>. The message seems correct,  otherwise the message would be too long and would not look like a standard VIM error message. ', '(Barriers 8, row 36) Problem: Bugs in the “:help todo” list do not have a very large description, which makes it difficult to understand what needs to be done. Solution: I noticed that in the first list I found (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list), bugs were being registered at a reasonable frequency, a lot of bugs have been added to the list since I started working on the project, so I decided to go back to that list. And I realized there were new issues. I chose a issue that was added to the list on October 29th. <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>\n', '(Barriers 8, row 44) I searched the internet for this error and found these two sites:\nhttp://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/Vim-build-error-quot-no-terminal-library-found-quot-Was-Reformatting-numbered-lists-td3876565.html\nhttp://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Vim\nIt seems that I needed to download some dependencies before installing VIM.\nIn the site http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Vim, I found the following command to download these dependencies: apt-get build-dep vim-gnome.\nAfter I downloaded these dependencies the “make” worked.', '(Barriers 8, row 52) Problem: How to submit the changes?\nSolution: In the VIM official website, there is a section about development, which is where I found the information to download the source code of VIM, and where I found the lists of bugs and improvements (http://www.vim.org/develop.php). In this website, I also found information about what needs to be sent to the development group. They ask to generate, with the help of a mercurial functionality, a .diff file that contains the differences between the current source code and the one that I worked.', '(Barriers 8, row 54) The problem was finding where to send my .diff file. This site said to send to a vim-dev mailing list.\nI found the mailing list here: http://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim-dev But I didn’t understand if I need to join the development group first. Because in this site http://www.vim.org/develop.php there was no information about it.\n', '(Barriers 8, row 55) I searched elsewhere and discovered a VIM FAQ here: http://vimhelp.appspot.com/vim_faq.txt.html. This site contains information about how to submit changes, and the site also says that in order to be able to send, you must first join the group. The information on how to join the group I found at: http://www.vim.org/maillist.php, I just needed to send an empty e-mail to vim-dev-subscribe@vim.org and wait for a confirmation.\n', '(Barriers 9, row 2) I started to study about the VIM project. I figured that I would get a link to a project presentation, but the goal probably is that the first step be a search on Google. Looking for “VIM Project” on Google, I found two projects:\n* VIM Project develops activities with 350 students (http://www.unochapeco.edu.br/psicologia/noticias/projeto-vim-desenvolve-atividades-com-350-estudantes)\n* VIM Project on Unicef (http://www.unicef.org/brazil/pt/media_26149.htm) Both project seems to be pretty cool, but the second one is pretty special.', '(Barriers 9, row 4) Visiting the website, I had some bad impressions:\nFirst, the english. Although there is only me at USP who does not speak English, I felt very uncomfortable with the project site, which was to be expected with my linguistic gap.\n', '(Barriers 9, row 16) Following the guidelines of the link above, I observed two important items:\nIn http://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim-dev there are separate mailing lists for branches of the project. For example: Lists for ads, development, questions, support, etc. In https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list there is a list with 97 items that seems to be about bugs. These bugs have an identification number, a summary, a status and a priority. My goal now is to identify and understand a bug that can be fixed by me.']"
